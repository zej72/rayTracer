Download binary from releases 
`chmod +x rayTracer
./rayTracer`

to try it yourself clone the source code and compile it using `g++  main.cpp rayTracer.cpp` and then run it with `./a.out` 

if it looks wrong you probably have too high resolution, try maximasing the window and scaling down the font or change the resolution in **main.cpp** (line 7 and 8)

some terminals are better then others, i recommend something like kitty or ghosty becouse they are able to display high fps
