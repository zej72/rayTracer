1. clone this repo
2. compile with `g++ main.cpp rayTracer.cpp` 
3. run `./a.out`

if it looks wrong you probably have too high resolution, try maximasing the window and scaling down the font or change the resolution in **main.cpp** (line 7 and 8)

some terminals are better then others, i recommend something like kitty or ghosty becouse they are able to display high fps
